# POS-HMM
Training a Hidden Markov Model for Part of Speech Tagging using the universal tagset from the 'news' category of the brown corpus.
Note, the brown corpus is already tagged and hence can be used for training. 90% is used to train and 10% is used to test. No shuffling was done for grading purposes.
